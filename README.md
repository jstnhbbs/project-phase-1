# Whine Night with Wine!

## Description

Are you ever just chilling with you other almost 30 year old girl friends and want to whine over wine but can't, for the life of you, choose which wine to drink? Well, have no fear, this app is for you!

This is a front-end JavaScript-based application made to be a parody of early 2000s MySpace aesthetic meets the “Eat. Pray.
Love” trope; it allows individuals to choose and filter various wines for their adult soirées.

## Technologies used:

Vanilla JavaScript
Note: code performs DOM manipulations in order to filter and store information client-side. It does not have a backend and therefore data does not persist.

## Background

This was my first project I worked on at my time at Flatiron School. I assisted with custom CSS and was the team lead for writing the filter functionality.
